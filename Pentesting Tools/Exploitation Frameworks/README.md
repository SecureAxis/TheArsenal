# Exploitation Frameworks

The art of exploitation made systematic! These frameworks facilitate the identification and leverage of vulnerabilities in systems to gain unauthorized access or perform unintended actions.

## Overview

Exploitation is the phase where the information gathered during reconnaissance is put to use. The goal here is to find a way into the system, elevate privileges, or achieve whatever the objective might be.

## Types of Tools Here

- **Metasploit**: A versatile framework for developing, testing, and executing exploit code.
- **BeEF**: The Browser Exploitation Framework for web application client-side attacks.
- **SQLMap**: Automated tool for SQL injection vulnerability detection and exploitation.

## How to Use the Tools

1. **Stay Ethical**: Only use these frameworks on systems you have express permission to test or on your own lab setups.
2. **Understand the Exploit**: Rather than just running exploits, make an effort to understand how they work. This knowledge is invaluable.
3. **Safety First**: Be cautious when using these tools, as improper use can disrupt services or damage systems.

## FAQs

**Q**: Are these tools legal?

**A**: The tools themselves are legal, but how they're used can be illegal. Always have permission before testing, and stay within legal and ethical boundaries.

**Q**: I have an exploit code. Can I integrate it into one of these frameworks?

**A**: Yes! Many frameworks are designed to be extensible. Check the documentation of the specific framework to understand how.
