# Reconnaissance Tools

Welcome to the heart of information gathering! Before you can exploit a system, you need to know as much about it as possible. Reconnaissance is all about gathering this crucial information.

## Overview

Reconnaissance is typically the first step in any pentesting or red teaming activity. It's the phase where an attacker gathers as much information as possible about the target system to find potential vulnerabilities or entry points.

## Types of Tools Here

- **DNS Enumeration Tools**: For mapping out domain structures and associated resources.
- **OSINT Tools**: Open Source Intelligence tools that gather data available in public domain.
- **IP Scanners**: Identify live hosts, open ports, and services running.

## How to Use the Tools

1. **Always Seek Permission**: Before using any tool against a target, always ensure you have the necessary permissions.
2. **Read the Documentation**: Each tool will come with its own set of instructions and documentation. Familiarize yourself with these before running the tool.
3. **Stay Updated**: Recon tools often receive updates with new features or fixes. Make sure you're using the latest version.

## FAQs

**Q**: Can I use these tools on any website or system?

**A**: No. Always seek permission before conducting any reconnaissance activity. Unauthorized scanning or data collection is illegal and unethical.

**Q**: I've found a vulnerability using one of the recon tools. What next?

**A**: Document your findings and if you have permission, move to the next phase of exploitation or report it to the system owner.
