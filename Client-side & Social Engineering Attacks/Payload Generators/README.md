# Payload Generators

Create versatile and deceptive payloads for various platforms and environments.

## Overview

Crafting the right payload is crucial to the success of an attack. This category is dedicated to tools and techniques that generate effective payloads for different attack vectors and targets.

## What's Inside

- **Stagers and Binders**: Techniques to bind payloads or deliver them in stages.
- **File-less Payloads**: Payloads that reside solely in memory.
- **Obfuscation Tools**: Make payloads harder to detect and analyze.
- **Cross-Platform Payloads**: Exploits that work on multiple operating systems.

Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions before deploying any payloads. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.
