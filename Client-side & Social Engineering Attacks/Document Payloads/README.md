# Document Payloads

A document is worth a thousand... exploits? Here, we dive deep into embedding malicious payloads within common document types, making them the perfect vector for delivering your attacks.

## Overview

Files, especially those of the doc and pdf variety, are often overlooked. However, they can be Trojan Horses, carrying malicious payloads that get executed once they're opened.

## What's Inside

- **Macro-based Attacks**: Leverage the power of macros to run malicious code.
- **Embedded Scripts**: Insert and hide scripts within seemingly innocent documents.
- **Exploit Kits**: Toolsets that target specific vulnerabilities within document readers.
- **Payload Delivery**: Techniques to wrap and deliver your malicious code without detection.

Always be mindful of the laws and regulations, and use these tools in an ethical manner!
