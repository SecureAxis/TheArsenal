## FAQ

**Q: What makes human-focused attacks so effective?**
A: Unlike automated defenses, humans are prone to making decisions based on emotions, trust, and social cues. This makes them susceptible to manipulation if approached correctly.

**Q: Are these tools ethical?**
A: Like all tools in the security domain, it's not about the tool but how it's used. These are intended for educational and authorized use only. Always seek permission before testing.
