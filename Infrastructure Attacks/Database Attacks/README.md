# Database Attacks

A focus on tools and techniques specifically designed to exploit databases, the treasure troves of sensitive data.

## Overview

Databases store a vast amount of crucial information. Protecting them is paramount, but understanding how they can be attacked is the first step.

## What's Inside

- **SQL Injection**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in SQL queries.
- **NoSQL Attacks**: Targeting databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.
- **Database Dumping**: Extracting all data from databases.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Elevating access within databases.

Knowledge about these attacks can be the key difference between a secure database and a compromised one.
