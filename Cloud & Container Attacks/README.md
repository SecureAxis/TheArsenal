# Cloud & Container Attacks

Welcome to the **Cloud & Container Attacks** toolkit at SecureAxis! As the world leans more towards containerized solutions and cloud platforms, it becomes imperative to address the vulnerabilities unique to these environments.

## What's Inside:

- **Cloud Platform Exploits**: Vulnerabilities specific to popular cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- **Container Vulnerabilities**: Diving deep into Docker, Kubernetes, and other container tech weak points.
- **Serverless Function Attacks**: Unveiling the threats in the world of serverless computing.
- **Cloud Misconfiguration Scanners**: Detect publicly exposed data and misconfigured services.

## FAQ

**Q: Are cloud platforms inherently insecure?**
A: No platform is inherently insecure, but misconfigurations and overlooked security best practices can make them vulnerable.

**Q: How can I safeguard my cloud infrastructure?**
A: Regular audits, understanding the shared responsibility model, and continuous monitoring are key.
