# Cloud & Container Attacks

Welcome to the **Cloud & Container Attacks** space of SecureAxis! As businesses transition to the cloud and embrace container technologies, understanding the potential vulnerabilities becomes paramount.

## What's Inside:

- **Cloud Platform Exploits**: Delving into vulnerabilities of major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- **Container Vulnerabilities**: From Docker to Kubernetes, dive into container tech weak points.
- **Serverless Attacks**: Exposing potential risks in serverless architectures.
- **Cloud Storage Exploits**: Uncovering security flaws in popular storage solutions.
- **API Vulnerabilities**: Explore potential loopholes in cloud-based APIs.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I secure my cloud infrastructure?**
A: Use a principle of least privilege, regularly audit permissions, ensure data encryption, and maintain a vigilant monitoring system.

**Q: Are containers safer than traditional VMs?**
A: Containers and VMs have different security models. While containers might isolate processes, VMs isolate entire operating systems. Proper configuration and timely updates are key for both.
