# Cross-Site Attacks

Web application vulnerabilities aren't just about what an attacker can do on their own, but also how they can leverage users to unknowingly perform malicious actions. Enter the world of cross-site attacks.

## Overview

"Cross-Site" typically refers to vulnerabilities where an attacker induces a victim to send a request they did not intend, potentially causing harmful actions to be performed without their knowledge.

## What's Inside

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A classic in the web application vulnerability world. Our tools here help identify where an application might unsafely include untrusted data.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Force users to perform actions without their consent or knowledge with these tools.

Leverage or defend against attacks that cross the boundary between users and web applications with the tools found in this section.
