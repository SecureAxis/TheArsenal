# Configuration & Deployment Management

As many developers know, getting the code to run is only half the battle. The way it's configured and deployed is equally crucial for security.

## Overview

Misconfigured security controls often lead to unintentional disclosure of sensitive information or even potential attack vectors. Dive into the challenges and solutions related to configuration and deployment.

## What's Inside

- **Server Misconfigurations**: Identify potential weaknesses in server settings and configurations.
- **Deployment Leaks**: Discover unintentional exposures like git directories, backup files, or admin panels.
- **Cloud Configuration Checks**: With the cloud becoming the new norm, ensure your configurations are airtight.

A secure application is as much about robust code as it is about correct configuration. Equip yourself with the right tools for the job here.
