  # Injection Attacks

Welcome to the realm of injection-based vulnerabilities and exploits. Injection flaws are some of the most potent vulnerabilities, providing adversaries a direct avenue to impact the underlying systems.

## Overview

In the realm of web applications, "injection" refers to introducing malicious input that gets processed by an interpreter. This can lead to a variety of undesirable outcomes, from data leakage to remote code execution.

## What's Inside

- **SQL Injections**: Famous for their potential impact, our tools here help you find and exploit SQL-based vulnerabilities.
- **NoSQL Injections**: Not just SQL databases are at risk. Explore tools that highlight NoSQL flaws.
- **OS Command Injections**: Manipulating application behavior by directly influencing OS-level commands.

Whether you're diving into a legacy system or a modern application, these tools will aid in uncovering and exploiting injection vulnerabilities.
