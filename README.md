# SecureAxis Arsenal 💼🔒

Welcome to the SecureAxis Arsenal! This repository serves as the primary armory for our red team operations, bug bounty hunting, and offensive security research. We've categorized and documented our tools, ensuring both our team and the community can utilize them effectively and responsibly.

## 📂 Categories

1. **Pentesting Tools**: Dive into our varied toolkit tailored for specific phases of penetration testing, from reconnaissance to post-exploitation.
    - [Reconnaissance Tools](./Pentesting%20Tools/Reconnaissance): Information gathering is a crucial step!
    - [Exploitation Frameworks](./Pentesting%20Tools/Exploitation%20Frameworks): Discovering vulnerabilities is half the battle. Exploiting them is another.
    - [Post Exploitation](./Pentesting%20Tools/Post%20Exploitation): Because sometimes you need to maintain that access.
    - [Miscellaneous](./Pentesting%20Tools/Miscellaneous): A mix of tools that don't fit neatly into one category but are just as important.
